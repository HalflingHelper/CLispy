# Clispy
My implementation of the lisp detailed in [Build Your Own Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com).

The current state of the language covers the first 14 chapters of the book, but I hope to
finish the tutorial and begin adding my own improvements to the language.

## Areas for Improvement
- Better Error Reporting (as implemented in chapter 11)
- Refactor to be more maintainable
- Write Tests
